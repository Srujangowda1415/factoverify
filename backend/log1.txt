Final Summary:

Without knowing what specific qualities are being evaluated when someone asks if idli is "good," it's impossible to give a definitive answer. The perception of whether idli is good seems to depend on individual preferences and priorities, whether it's health benefits or taste.

At the bottom of this lake surrounded by mountains lies almost forgotten communities. Tennessee Valley Authority flooded several Swain County communities to form Fontana Lake to power Fontana Dam. For many, this is a story of the past, a lost world forever gone, but for others the sting is ever present.
There are still those who remember a time before their family’s rugged land was stripped from them. [...] “Whenever they built the dam, they told a lot of people that they could come back to visit their homes, but when these people would come back, they would find that the Tennessee Valley Authority had burnt their house down,” Kirkland said. “Both the National Park and TVA did people wrong. I think a lot of the people living back then are better off than we are today,” he said with an ironic laugh. [...] The impact of these memories has stuck with her for her entire life. After all these decades, she said, there’s still anger for her.
“I've never been particularly happy about the dam being built. The government never gave the people nothing,” she said. “They kicked people out, with hardly enough time to even grab what they owned. If the people around here had any brains, they would feel the same way I do about the Tennessee Valley Authority.”

Freshwater on the land surface is a vital part of the water cycle for everyday human life. On the landscape, freshwater is stored in rivers,
A lake is an often naturally occurring, relatively large and fixed body of water on or near the Earth's surface. It is localized in a basin or interconnected basins surrounded by dry land.[1] Lakes lie completely on land and are separate from the ocean, although they may be connected with the ocean by rivers. Lakes, as with other bodies of water, are part of the water cycle, the processes by which water moves around the Earth. Most lakes are fresh water and account for almost all the world's [...] Most lakes have at least one natural outflow in the form of a river or stream, which maintain a lake's average level by allowing the drainage of excess water.[3][16] Some lakes do not have a natural outflow and lose water solely by evaporation or underground seepage, or both. These are termed endorheic lakes.
Many lakes are artificial and are constructed for hydroelectric power generation, aesthetic purposes, recreational purposes, industrial use, agricultural use, or domestic water supply. [...] Changes in the level of a lake are controlled by the difference between the input and output compared to the total volume of the lake. Significant input sources are precipitation onto the lake, runoff carried by streams and channels from the lake's catchment area, groundwater channels and aquifers, and artificial sources from outside the catchment area. Output sources are evaporation from the lake, surface and groundwater flows, and any extraction of lake water by humans. As climate conditions
Lakes supply many communities with water. Artificial lakes are used to store water for times of drought. Lakes formed by dams also provide hydroelectric energy. The water is channeled from the lake to drive generators that produce electricity. [...] Lakes are valuable resources for people in a variety of ways. Through the centuries, lakes have provided routes for travel and trade. The Great Lakes of North America, for example, are major inland routes for ships carrying grain and raw materials such as iron ore and coal. [...] Lake

Now India's official opposition leader, Rahul Gandhi will play a crucial role
Rahul Gandhi of the Congress party has been appointed leader of the opposition in India's parliament, filling a post that had been empty for a decade. [...] He has often been mocked by Mr Modi and the BJP as a non-serious politician. But analysts say that two long marches he undertook across the country in the past couple of years helped him undo that image.
While he’s no longer the official leader of the Congress, he also won both the parliamentary seats he contested - in Wayanad of Kerala state, and Rae Bareli in Uttar Pradesh - with massive majorities. [...] "The decision to accept the new role suggests a new confidence... inside him," Mr Srinivasaraju said.
"He has made a dent and he has to carefully build on it."
